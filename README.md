# Frakkas  
  
## Description
---

The project's goal is to produce a game from an adapted homemade game engine. The project lasted 4 months, and we are a group of 3 second-year Game Programmer students, supervised by a fifth-year student.  
  
Our engine is called **_Frakkas_**, and our game **_Frakkarena_**. The game is a Top-Down Survival Beat'em up in a fantasy world, with a toon aspect. That was cool to code this game with the engine, and we could make whatever other type of game thanks to an efficient entity/component system.  
  
In short,  **_Frakkas_** is a 3D casual game engine, with animations, shadows, and toon shading.

## Open in an IDE
---

If you are using CLion, just open the project directly with it.  
In case you are using Visual Studio Community/Enterprise 2022, check our tutorial on our wiki: accessible [here](https://gitlabstudents.isartintra.com/projets/2021_gp_2025_engine_gp_2025_engine-frakkas/-/wikis/Launch%20project%20with%20Visual%20Studio).

## Update submodules
---

The engine integrate several submodules.  
They are normally automaticaly update with the main CMakeLists.txt but in case you encounter problems here is three solutions:
1. In the project source directory, open a Git Bash command prompt and execute this command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. In each submodule directory located in extern/ (ex: Frakkas/extern/tracy), execute this command in a Git Bash command prompt: `git checkout`
